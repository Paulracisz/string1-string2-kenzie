# Kenzie Academy: Strings Assignment
For this assessment, you'll be completing some string manipulation functions within the string1.py and string2.py files.

There is some light dependency on knowing how
[Functions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
work in python in terms of argument passing and return values, but you should
be able to figure it out as you go.

[string1.py](./string1.py) -- Complete the string functions in string1.py, based on your knowledge of Python strings, indexing, slicing, and methods.  Make sure all the tests are passing, before submitting your work.

[string2.py](./string2.py) -- Additional string function completions.  Again, make sure all tests are passing before submitting your work.


## PR (Pull Request) Workflow for this Assignment
1. *Fork* this repository into your own personal github account.
2. Then *Clone* your own repo to your local development machine.
3. Create a separate branch named `dev`, and checkout the branch.
5. Commit your changes, then `git push` the branch back to your own github account.
5. From your own Github repo, create a pull request (PR) from your `dev` branch back to your own master.
6. Copy/Paste the URL **link to your PR** as your assignment submission.
7. Your grader will post code review comments inline with your code, in your github account. Be sure to respond to any comments and make requested changes. **RESUBMIT** a new link to your PR after making changes.  This is the code review iteration cycle.

# Extra Points:
Feel free to edit the README.md (this very text itself) of this assignment and enhance it.  The README is the front-most facing page of your work, so it should make a good impression.  As assigments get more complex, you will be expected to create READMEs with sufficient detail to capture all aspects of how your code is intended to be used: Cloning, dependencies, gotchas, quick-starts, deployment notes, etc.
